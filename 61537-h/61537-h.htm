avoided.</span> 3. Means to preſerve the body from Infection.</i></p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/droptbig.jpg" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="dropcap">Th</span>ere are divers cauſes of this diſeaſe.
The firſt is ſin, which
ought to be repented of. The ſecond
an infected and corrupted
air, which ſhould be avoided. The
third an evill diet, which ſhould
be amended. The fourth are evill
humours heaped together in the
body, being apt to putrifie, and beget a Fever, which
muſt be taken away by convenient medicines.</p>

<p>Therefore whoſoever would preſerve their bodies
from infection, let them firſt make their peace with
God, in whoſe hand is the power of life and death.
Then let them uſe the meanes, and ſhun all thoſe
things that are able to beget this diſeaſe, as all infected
and corrupted aire, all fogges and miſts that do
ariſe from the earth or water, and all ſtinking ſmels
that do ariſe from dunghills, ſinks, graves, carrion,
ſnuffs of candles, or rotten fruits, or any thing elſe
that doth putrifie and ſtink. Abſtain from all meats
and drinks that beget rottenneſſe and filthineſſe in
<a name="png.008" id="png.008" href="#png.008"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>2<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the body (&amp; ſo conſequently a Fever or the Plague)
as exceſſive eating of fruits, eſpecially thoſe that are
unripe. Alſo forbear all ſorts of fiſh that have neither
ſcales nor ſhels, as Eels, Lampreys, and the like. Laſtly,
take heed of over-charging the ſtomacke with
meats, or drinks, or hot Wines; but eſpecially your
unripe medium Wines.</p>

<p>If any ſhall find themſelves oppreſſed with groſs &amp;
corrupt humors, ſo that they are in danger of this diſeaſe
they ſhall be cleanſed, by taking one ounce and
half, or two ounces, of the infuſion <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crocus metallorum</i>,
(which is to be bought at every Apothecaries) &amp; put
to it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oximel</i> half an ounce, this ſhall give them five or
ſix vomits, and almoſt as many ſtooles. And after
every vomit, let them drinke ſome warme poſſet
drinke; ſo let them keepe themſelves warme that
day: one houre after it hath done working let
them eat a meſſe of warm broth made with a neck of
Mutton, or with ſuch freſh meat as the ſick are beſt
able to buy; of which meat let them eat ſparingly for
the preſent. Thoſe that are ſo tender or weakly that
they cannot brook this vomit, they may be very well
purged from corrupt humours, by taking one or two
drams of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pilulæ Peſtilentiales</i>: But the poorer ſort that
cannot goe to this charge, may take inſtead thereof
<i>Aloes</i> one dram in the pap of an Apple, ſtewed
Prunes, or elſe in a little Ale or Beere.  This pill, and
this <i>Aloes</i>, are excellent remedies for women and
children, and they are ſo ſafe that women with child
may take them. After the bodie is purged, it ſhall
be neceſſary to draw ſix or eight ounces of bloud
from the liver or middle vein of the arme, if the partie
be able to ſuſtain the loſſe of it.</p>

conſequently are not oppreſſed with corrupted humours,
ſuch ſhall not need any the aforeſaid evacuations
or purgations; but let them ſhun, as much as
they can, all infectious and corrupted aire: But ſeeing
it is a thing almoſt impoſsible in the Citie of
<i>London</i>; therefore they that are timorous and fearefull
may carry about them the roots of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Enula campana</i>,
and <i>Angelica</i>, dried or candied, of which they
may bite now and then. Alſo the waters of <i>Scabios<!-- TN: original reads "Scabies" --></i>,
<i>Angelica</i>, or <i>Pimpernell</i>, are great preſervations for
children againſt the Plague, if two ſpoonfuls thereof
be taken in a morning faſting.</p>




<h2 class="nothere" title="Chapter 2">Chap. 2.</h2>

<p class="subhead"><i><span class="sentence">1 By what ſignes you may know whether the ſick be infected

decreaſe every day;</span> <span class="sentence">3 Whether life or death be likely to
enſue;</span> 4 A caveat not to tamper with thoſe that begin
to amend of themſelves.</i></p>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">Th</span>oſe that are infected with the Peſtilence, in the
beginning or firſt day thereof, are taken with an
extraordinary cold outwardly, and a burning heate
inwardly, a great paine and girding about the ſtomacke,
a ſluggiſhneſſe and drouſineſſe of the whole
body, a loſſe of appetite, a bitterneſſe in the throat,
with a deſire to vomit, &amp; ſometimes they do vomit.</p>

<p>The diſeaſe continuing unto the ſecond and third
day, the heate breaketh outwardly, ſtronger, and
ſtronger, ſo that there followeth a great paine in the
<a name="png.010" id="png.010" href="#png.010"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>4<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>head, and a difficulty of breathing, ſuperfluous ſleeps,
and ſometimes ſuperfluous watchings, they grow
frantike and light-headed, and they looke very ſtaringly:
And if there doth any ſwelling appear under
the eares, armes, cheeks, or groines, and that theſe
ſignes aforenamed doe begin to ceaſe, Then ſhall the
ſick recover immediatly without any medicine, onely
give him a plaſter or pulteſſe to ripen the tumour,
which muſt be applyed the next day after the ſwelling
appeareth; but give him nothing inwardly, except
it be a warme Caudle, or Ale-brue, or Broth; for
<!-- TN: original reads "for for" --> if you give him a vomit or purge, you ſhall ſtrike
the ſwelling into the noble parts, and the ſick ſhall
be in danger of his life: and if you let him bloud, you
ſhall draw the venemous humour from the Soare into
the veins, and diſperſe it with the bloud through the
whole body, and thereby deſtroy the health of the
patient, and ſhorten his life; as it came to paſſe with
a good friend of mine. Alſo if you give him any medicine
to provoke ſweat, you ſhall reſtore the Fever
again, and ſo the ſicke ſhall die without redemption;
yea, and more miſerably, then thoſe that never amended,
unleſſe God be more mercifull unto him;
whereof I have had a ſorrowfull experience.</p>

<p>Therefore bee carefull that you doe not tamper
with thoſe that do begin to amend: for thoſe very
Medicines that are excellently available againſt any
Fevers in the beginning or encreaſe of them, being
given in the declination or recovery, will bring the
patient into a Relapſe, which is worſe then the former
diſeaſe, and which ſhall greatly endanger life.
For how many have died by the unſeaſonable taking
of Treacle, Mithridate, and other good Medicines?
<a name="png.011" id="png.011" href="#png.011"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>5<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Wherefore I have often ſaid, that a skilfull Phyſician
by watching his time ſhall doe more with a cup of
warme drinke in the cure of the Plague, or any Fever,
then the ignorant ſhall do with all the excellent
Medicines that are in the Apothecaries Shop.</p>

<p>Now if the riſing doe appear, &amp; that the ſymptoms
or ſignes aforenamed doe not begin to ceaſe, but rather
encreaſe, Then ſhortly after there will appeare
ſome blains or ſpots, &amp; ſo death enſueth, unleſſe you
draw ten or twelve ounces of bloud (according to
the ſtrength of the ſick) from the liver or middle vein
of the arme, on that ſide where the riſing is.</p>

<p>But if ſo be that the ſickneſſe continueth unto the
third and fourth day, and the ſymptomes remaine
in their full vigour, then ſhortly will the ſpots come
forth; and then I know no medicine that can deliver
from death, except God be more mercifull to the
ſick: But only on the third day before the ſpots appear
it ſhall be greatly available to give him one of
the cordial ſweats preſcribed in the enſuing Chapter.</p>




<h2 class="nothere" title="Chapter 3">Chap. 3.</h2>

<p class="subhead"><i><span class="sentence">1 Here are preſcribed certain approved remedies for the
cure of the Peſtilence,</span> 2 The order and manner how
to uſe them.</i></p>


<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">Wh</span>oſoever ſhal perceive their bodies infected
with the Plague, let them take on the firſt
day of the ſickneſſe the vomit, in that order and manner
as it is laid down in the firſt Chapter. And after
it hath done working with them, they ſhal find
<a name="png.012" id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>6<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>themſelves as well as ever they were in their lives: for it
clenſeth the ſtomack and bowels from al corrupt humours,
which is one of the chiefeſt cauſes of the ſicknes.
But if the ſick be weak and cannot bear a vomit,
it ſhall be good to give him one dram of the foreſaid
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pillulæ peſtilentiales</i>, or inſtead thereof one dram of
<i>Aloes</i>, you may give it either in pill or in potion, according
as the ſick can beſt take it, and in the working<!-- TN: original reads "work-king" (linebreak hyphen) -->
of it let him drink ſome warm broth.</p>

<p>But if it be ſo, that this courſe hath been neglected
the firſt day, or beyond the time of 24 houres, it will
bee in vaine to uſe it the ſecond day: Yea, it will bee
dangerous, ſeeing that the infection is diſperſed by
the bloud throughout all the Veines of the bodie.
Therefore on the ſecond day of Viſitation it ſhall
bee good to draw from the Median Veine of the
arme ſo much bloud as the patient can endure to
bleed: and if the ſicke hath not gone to the ſtoole during
the time of his ſickneſſe, you ſhall give him
either before or after bleeding this Clyſter. <i>Take of
Beets, Violet leaves, Burrage, Bugloſſe, Scabios, of each one
handfull, French barley one ounce; boyle all theſe in a ſufficient
quantitie of water untill it be halfe conſumed, then
ſtrain it, and take three quarters of a pint of the decoction,
and put to it of the Electuary of Hierapicra five or ſixe
drams, oile of Rue one dram, red Sugar one ounce, the yolk
of an egge, and a little ſalt; ſo make you a Clyſter thereof
and adminiſter it bloud warme.</i> Alſo you may adminiſter
to the ſick this Clyſter. <i>Boyle an handfull of Rue
in a pint of poſſet drinke, and put to it a piece of ſweet butter,
a little honey, the yolke of an egge, and a thimble full of ſalt;

 </span></span></a>taken the ſecond day, or that this means hath not been
uſed, but that hee continued ſick untill the third and
fourth day, ſo that the infection hath taken hold of
the vitall ſpirits, Then keeping him warme in his bed,
you ſhall uſe this Cordiall to ſweat with all. <i>Take
of the water of Scabios, Burrage, Bugloſſe, and Angelica,
of each halfe an ounce, the Electuary of egges two ſcruples,
or one dram, of Bole<!-- TN: in original the "B" is not italic --> Armoniak one ſcruple, Syrrup of
Roſes halfe an ounce, make it into a potion</i>, and let the ſick
drink it up at once or twice: two or three ſpoonfuls
hereof is ſufficient for a child. Or the poorer ſort
may take two peny-worth of Treacle or Mithridate,
in a quarter of a pint of Dragon water. With either of
theſe Medicines you may ſweat the ſick, untill ſome
tumour doth appeare, or that he commeth to know
himſelfe amended. For this is the laſt medicinall refuge
we have in the cure of the Plague. If you can,
keep the ſick from drinking and ſleeping for the ſpace
of three houres untill the medicine hath done working<!-- TN: original reads "work-king" (linebreak hyphen) -->.
But if you cannot, let the patient drinke a little
Limon poſſet, made with ſome Marigold flowers,
and Harts horn.</p>

<p>And if ſignes of amendment doe appeare, doe not
take him out of his bed, or let him coole ſuddenly:
But let him ſweat on gently of his own accord, for it
is natures ſweat following the medicine, which will
doe him more good than a Kingdome. In this laſt
ſweat you may give him ſome Caudle or Alebrue: &amp;
when the ſweats begin to ceaſe of themſelves, &amp; his
skin grows dry and warme, then let him ſit up by a
good fire; Aire his cloathes, and ſo let him give God
thanks for his life.</p>

<p>Adde, if any tumour appeare you may ripen it
<a name="png.014" id="png.014" href="#png.014"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>8<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>with this Emplaſter. <i>Take ſix figs, raiſins of the Sun
ſtoned half an ounce, ſalt two drams, honey one ounce, beat
them all together, and heat it well with ſome oile of Camomill
upon the fire, ſo ſpread it upon ſome cloth</i>, and lay it
warm to the tumour, ſhifting it every twelve houres
untill it look with a white head: and when it is ripe,
if it be difficult to break, lay to it ſome Gooſe dung
made warme with ſome ſweet butter or ſallet oile;
alſo the root of a white Lilly roſted, with ſome ſorrell,
to which put a piece of ſweet butter, &amp; apply it
very warm to the ſoare, But if it will not break with
this means, then you muſt open it with a penknife or
lancet; elſe the corruption will rot the fleſh, even to
the very bone, and when you have opened it, ſqueeze
out the corruption with your hands, and put into the
ſoare, a tent made with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unguentum baſilicon</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ægyptiacum,
&amp; mel roſarum</i>, and lay upon the tent a plaſter
made with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diachilon</i>: Continue your tents untill all
the corruption be drawn out, then the plaſter of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diachilon</i>
will cure it perfectly.</p>

<p>If any that are ancient or weak ſhall be infected
with the Peſtilence, it ſhall not be neceſſary to give
them any purge, vomit, or ſweat, or to let them
bloud; becauſe they cannot beare the loſſe of ſo many
ſpirits as are ſpent by ſuch evacuations. Therefore
you may lay upon the pit of the ſtomack of the ſicke
a young live puppy, and if the ſick can but ſleep the
ſpace of three or foure houres, they ſhall recover
preſently, and the dog ſhall die of the Plague. This I
have known approved; and I do believe that it will
be a cure for all leane, ſpare, and weake bodies both
yong and old: provided, that the dog be yonger then
the ſick.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="dropcap">Th</span>e nature of the Smal Pox diſperſed
this yeer throughout many parts of this
Kingdome, I have found to bee more
malignant, then any that have reigned
in my remembrance; ſo that many
of all ages and ſexes, but eſpecially children have
miſerably died of them: becauſe for the moſt part,
the peſtilence is joyned with them, as it doth plainly
appeare by thoſe ſpots, blains, and riſings, that follow
them. I have likewiſe obſerved that thoſe medicines,
as <i>Mithridate</i>, <i>Treacle</i>, <i>Saffron</i><!-- TN: original reads "Safforn" but OED dates this variant much earlier than 1641 --> and the like, that
formerly have cured the ſmall Pox, now availe
nothing: yea, they are dangerous, if inwardly taken
(eſpecially if the Patient hath been long ſick) but if
they be outwardly applyed, as I ſhall ſhew eft-ſoons,
they will prove good remedies at this time. But how
many a tender hearted mother have I ſeen that, out
of an unhappie care of her ſicke childe, hath by
raſh counſel &amp; the unſeaſonable giving to it hot cordiall
medicines, encreaſed the Fever, multiplyed the
matter of the ſmall pox, and inflamed the Spirits, ſo
that the Peſtilence hath many times followed. But
howſoever the child hath<!-- TN: original reads "harh" --> beene uncurable, which
otherwiſe if nothing at all, or elſe ſome ſmall thing
of little ſtrength, had been adminiſtred, might have
<a name="png.016" id="png.016" href="#png.016"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>10<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>recovered; whereupon I obſerved the ſundry ways
and meanes practiſed by Phyſitians, women, and my
ſelfe, and ſeeing the diverſe events of them, I laboured
to find out a certain and ſecure way for the cure
of this diſeaſe; which having found by experience
I have (together with this treatiſe of the Plague) ſent
it to the Preſſe, hoping that no man will either hate
mee, or envie mee, for doing good, and that thoſe
that find benefit by it will thank me for it.</p>

<p>The Primitive or externall cauſes of the Small
Pox are all one with thoſe which are of the Plague,
as an evill and corrupted aire, a diſorderly dyet, that
begets ſurfets; as alſo for the antecedent cauſes which
are corrupt humours heaped together in the body:
therefore thoſe meanes that I have preſcribed in
the firſt Chapter to preſerve the bodie from the
infection of the Plague, they will alſo bee a
meanes to preſerve from the Small Pox. Thoſe that
are taken ſick this yeere with the Small Pox are affected
after the ſame manner as thoſe that are infected
with the peſtilence, &amp; in the beginning it can ſcarcely
be diſcerned by an expert Phyſitian from it, But
only by theſe ſignes.</p>

<p>Thoſe that are infected by the ſmall Pox are not
ſo violently affected with heat and cold, nor pains in
the ſtomack and head, as thoſe that are ſick with the
Peſtilence.<!-- TN: original has comma --></p>

<p>Moreover, thoſe that will have the ſmall Pox their
skin is puft up, and blown like a bladder, ſo that their
face and eyes doe ſhine: they have a great itching
in many parts of their bodies, but chiefly about their
Noſe; they yawn much, alſo they finde a great paine
and heavineſſe in their back bone.</p>

<p><a name="png.017" id="png.017" href="#png.017"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>11<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Now if you ſhall perceive by theſe ſignes, that the
ſick will have the ſmall Pox, keep him warm, but not
too hot; neither let him take cold; but give him
breathing room enough, as he lyeth in his bed: Then
lay a plaſter of Mithridate or Treacle to the pit of his
ſtomack, and if hee be at mans eſtate, let him drinke
up all this Cordiall by two or three ſpoonfuls at a
time every houre; but if it be a child, the one halfe
will be ſufficient. <i>Take of the waters of Roſes, Burrage,
Bugloſſe, and Treacle-water, of each an ounce &amp; half, of the
ſyrrup of Limons, and Clove-gilly-flowers of each one ounce,
mix them together, and make thereof a potion</i>: Alſo the
poorer ſort may take <i>Roſes, Burrage, Carduus, Marigold
Flowers, and Harts horn, of each a like quantitie, and
boyle them in poſſet drinke, turned with a Limon, or white
wine</i>: for one above twenty yeers of age let him drink
three quarters of a pint at ſeverall times, ſweetned
with Sugar; and for a child halfe the quantitie will
ſuffice. Let the ſick ſweat gently with either of theſe
Medicines ſo long as hee can well endure it: for the
longer the better; ſeeing the Medicines of themſelves
are no violent ſweats; &amp; during the ſweat you
may give him now and then to quench his thirſt a very
little Limon poſſet-drink by it ſelf. If he can you
may let him ſleep whilſt he ſweateth. And if hee lie
quiet during the ſweat, by Gods bleſſing, within the
ſpace of eight or ten houres at the moſt, he ſhall find
himſelf finely recovered of his ſickneſſe. Then give
him no more of his Cordial or ſweating poſſet drink,
but only of his <span title="Limon-posset">Limõ-poſſet</span> drink, if he be thirſty; but
let him lie warm in his bed til his skin grow dry, then
ſhortly after the Pox will begin to ſhew themſelves.
But they will not bee many although every one of
<a name="png.018" id="png.018" href="#png.018"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>them will be far greater then the ſmall Pox do uſe to
be; yet none of them will pit except they be much
tampered withal, or picked with the nails. But if ſo be
that thoſe which have white heads do burn and rage
extreamly, you may prick their heads with a Needle
and let out the corruption: there is nothing elſe to be
done with thoſe upon whom they are come out, and
the Fever abated but that they keepe themſelves
warm, ſit ſtill and be quiet.</p>

<p>But if that the ſick hath not gone to ſtool in a long
time: before you give him this Cordiall to ſweat, you
ſhall cauſe him to goe to ſtoole by a clyſter, or elſe
which is better by a Suppoſitor made with Honey
and Salt, or a Violet Comfit. And if the ſicke bee
yong, ſtrong, and full of bloud, you ſhall without
danger doe very well, if you draw from him eight or
ten ounces of bloud before you lay him to ſweat; for
then the Cordiall will have more power, room, and
liberty, to play upon the diſeaſe, and will the ſooner
and better drive out the Pox. If the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quinteſſentia vitæ</i>
be given in the waters of Roſes, Burrage, or Bugloſſe,
it will drive out the ſmall Pox without ſweating, and
cure the ſick immediatly.</p>

<p>But if the ſmall Pox be come forth, and that the
Fever continue in his full vigour ſtill, ſo that the ſick
doth not amend, but grow worſe and worſe, then you
ſhall not give them any hot Medicines inwardly, nor
any thing that doth provoke ſweat; for now hot cordiall
Medicines will encreaſe the Fever (and in the
beginning they would have quenched the Fever) and
turn all the humours of the body into the matter of
the ſmall Pox; ſo that there is nothing but a miſerable
death likely to follow, oftentimes accompanied
with the Peſtilence.</p>

<p><a name="png.019" id="png.019" href="#png.019"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>13<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>This evill is much practiſed by thoſe women that
<span title="pretend">pretẽd</span> they wil drive the ſmal Pox further out, when
they are come out already. Wherefore they do but
beget the Fever again, and where there are but ten
they will make a thouſand. Therefore be carefull in
this caſe, what you do, and give to the ſick every
hower nothing elſe but two or three ſpoonefulls of
Roſe water, ſweetened with a little ſugar. This will
coole the body, quench the Fever, cauſe reſt, and
then a ſtoole, and thereby the ſick ſhall recover preſently.
By theſe meanes I have cured many very ſuddenly
that have been dangerouſly ſick in all mens
ſight even to Death, as many in the City can beare
mee witneſſe.</p>

<p>As I have warned you not to give many hot
things when the ſmall Pox are come forth, ſo I
would have you beware of giving thoſe that are very cold,
as the waters of Plantane, Letice, Purſlane,
Poppy, and the like; which (as I have Knowne) have
relieved many for the preſent, and wrought an admirable
cure in the ſight of the common people; but by
their cold qualities, they have ſo congealed and ſetled
the humours in the body, that the ſick will never
be healthfull all the daies of their lives, as I could inſtance
in many.</p>
